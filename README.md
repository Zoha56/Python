## PYTHON 
This repository contain the codes I have practiced/written in my 3rd semester as a part of introduction to data science course.
From basic print("hello world!") to writing list and dictionaries to doing data analysis on different datasets.
### LAB 1🖱️
#### 🧠 Overall Understanding & Reflection
In this lab, I focused on converting unstructured patient data into a clean and usable format. I parsed each record, separated fields like name, age, disease, and medicines, and stored them in dictionaries for easier processing. Once the data was organized, answering the tasks became more systematic — I applied filtering, counting, searching, and calculating averages using basic Python structures such as lists, sets, and loops.

Throughout the lab, I practiced breaking down problems into smaller steps, especially when working with messy strings and extracting useful information. This helped me understand how real data often needs cleaning before analysis. I also strengthened my confidence in handling dictionaries, iterating over records, and generating meaningful summaries from data.

Overall, the lab improved my logical thinking, data-handling skills, and ability to write clear, structured code to solve practical problems.
