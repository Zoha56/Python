## PYTHON 
This repository contain the codes I have practiced/written in my 3rd semester as a part of introduction to data science course.
From basic print("hello world!") to writing list and dictionaries to doing data analysis on different datasets.
### LAB 1🖱️
#### 🧠 Overall Understanding & Reflection
In this lab, I focused on converting unstructured patient data into a clean and usable format. I parsed each record, separated fields like name, age, disease, and medicines, and stored them in dictionaries for easier processing. Once the data was organized, answering the tasks became more systematic — I applied filtering, counting, searching, and calculating averages using basic Python structures such as lists, sets, and loops.

Throughout the lab, I practiced breaking down problems into smaller steps, especially when working with messy strings and extracting useful information. This helped me understand how real data often needs cleaning before analysis. I also strengthened my confidence in handling dictionaries, iterating over records, and generating meaningful summaries from data.

Overall, the lab improved my logical thinking, data-handling skills, and ability to write clear, structured code to solve practical problems.

## Applied Python Assignment ☑️
## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Learned to store, manage, and analyze data using lists, dictionaries, and functions.
- Built multiple real-world mini-systems (cart, billing, attendance, bookings, finance tracker).
- Practiced input processing, validation, and data cleaning.
- Performed calculations such as totals, averages, highest values, and summaries.
- Extracted insights like top performers, frequent items, mutual friends, and fastest routes.
- Organized data by categories (expenses, books, domains, authors).
- Improved ability to design structured, modular, and reusable code.
- Strengthened problem-solving skills through real-world programming scenarios.
# CMS assignment 👨‍🎓
## Approach
- Parsed raw student records stored as strings into structured Python dictionaries.
- Used string operations (`split`, `strip`) to extract keys and values.
- Converted numeric fields (`id`, `attendance`, `marks`) into appropriate data types.
- Calculated department-wise average attendance using dictionaries.
- Filtered students with low attendance using conditional checks.

## Learning Outcomes
- Learned how to clean and transform unstructured text data into structured formats.
- Practiced type conversion, error handling, and dictionary manipulation.
- Improved understanding of data parsing, aggregation, and filtering in Python.
- Gained experience writing modular code with reusable functions.
